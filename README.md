Gamification Prototype for Honours Research

You need to create an uploads folder for any files that you wish to upload in the main directory


To set up the environment:
$ php -S localhost:3000 (or any free port)

Then in Google Chrome/another web browser type in:
http://localhost:3000/ (or the specified port)

You can find my honours research project paper in the uploads folder to understand more background about the system.

Please remember that it is just a proof of concept so it is not fully developed/tested.

It is only a prototype for demonstration purposes to get the project idea across.
